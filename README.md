# LearnFusion_-AgeCalculator
This is a web-based Age Calculator that allows users to calculate their age based on their submitted date of birth (day, month, and year). The project uses JavaScript's built-in date and time functions to simplify the age calculation process, making it easy to determine someone's age.
